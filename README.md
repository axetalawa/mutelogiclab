# Mute Logic Meta — Browser Ecologies of Thought

> *A constellation of standalone prototypes — each one a small world mapping the geometry of dialogue, coherence, and recursion.*

---

## 🌐 Overview

This repository functions as the **meta-index** for the **Mute Logic Lab** browser experiments — lightweight, self-contained simulations exploring how cognition takes shape in visible form.  
Each HTML file is a complete environment: no build step, no backend, only the browser as medium.

The prototypes are written in **HTML + CSS + JavaScript** (using [Three.js](https://threejs.org), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com), and small ES-modules).  
They visualize concepts central to the Lab’s research: adjacency, return, coherence, and resonance — the living architecture of dialogue.

## 🚀 Quickstart

Clone the repo and serve it locally:

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/<you>/<repo>.git
cd <repo>

# Run a simple static server (Node.js ≥ 18)
npm init -y
npm install --save-dev serve
npx serve -p 5050 .

# Open in your browser:
#   http://localhost:5050/index.html          — Main portal
#   http://localhost:5050/onion.html          — The Onion Simulation
#   http://localhost:5050/ledger.html         — Dialogue Ledger
#   http://localhost:5050/atlas.html          — Latent Atlas
#   http://localhost:5050/constellation.html  — Constellation Charts

Each page runs independently; no database or server process is required.

| **`index.html`**         | Portal and navigation for all simulations.                             | Tailwind CSS, vanilla JS |
| **`onion.html`**         | 3D recursive shell — layers of thought visualized as nested resonance. | Three.js, TWEEN.js       |
| **`ledger.html`**        | *Dialogue Ledger* — records conversational balance and agency.         | Canvas API, vanilla JS   |
| **`atlas.html`**         | *Latent Atlas* — topological mapping of semantic trajectories.         | Three.js                 |
| **`constellation.html`** | *Constellation Charts* — conversation as starfield geometry.           | Three.js                 |

## 🧠 Conceptual Spine

> *Cognition is not line — it is lattice, echo, and fold.*

Each prototype corresponds to a gesture of thought:

* **Constellation** — coherence as stellar adjacency
* **Atlas** — mapping latent continuity
* **Ledger** — balancing agency across turns
* **Onion** — recursion as nested shell
* **Index** — the membrane linking them all

Together they form a **browser ecology**, showing how intelligence can inhabit the interface itself rather than live above it.

## ⚙️ Technical Notes

* **Tech stack:** HTML 5, CSS 3, ES Modules, [Three.js](https://threejs.org), [TWEEN.js](https://github.com/tweenjs/tween.js), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
* **Deployment:** works on any static host (GitHub Pages, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages)
* **Dependencies:** none beyond the included CDNs
* **Recommended Node version:** ≥ 18 LTS (for local server via `npx serve`)

## 🌒 Philosophy

> The browser is not a window — it is a membrane.
> Each experiment is a *ritual machine* translating between cognition and form.
> To observe them is to witness dialogue made visible: a choreography of coherence and return.
